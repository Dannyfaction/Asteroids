# Asteroids
steroids was my very first group project. We had learned Actionscript 3 for 2 months prior to this project and we were ready to be working with artists to make a complete game. 

The assignment was to make an Asteroids-like game. We gave our own twist to it and made it into an educational game where you needed to solve easy calculations to gain score. The goal was to make learning fun.

We had not learned to code efficiently or to code object orientated, so the code may look messy and way too many functions in 1 file
